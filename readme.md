Fun project I made in 2 days to challenge myself.
Lets you search files in a folder quickly, either by literal filename match or an AI powered search.

File data from a previous scan will go into file_index.json so that next time you check for a file from there, it'll be much faster.

Instructions:
Run main.py through command prompt / terminal (VSC and some other code editors may not work for the folder prompt)
Select a folder when prompted.
Choose which type of search you want.
Type your search query.

Note: file_index.json stores file data from your last scan so searches run faster next time.
